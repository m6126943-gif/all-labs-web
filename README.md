# mohamed Abdelrazek - Portfolio (Lab)

This project was updated to:
- Replace occurrences of "Nady Emad" with "mohamed Abdelrazek".
- Remove all comments from HTML, CSS and JS files.
- Keep original functionality (form, DB connection, scripts) intact.

Files changed:
- lab3.html: updated title, meta, header and image alt text; removed HTML comments.
- css.css: removed CSS comments and fixed small typo.
- js.js: removed all comments.

How to run:
- Serve the folder with PHP (e.g., using XAMPP) so submit.php can connect to the database.
- Ensure DB settings in connect.php are correct.
